This is my dissertation draft for my PartII project.

You can use `\comment{}` to leave a comment in the margins, feel free to add yourself by name in `setup.tex`.

Please either remove any `\resolved{}` comments addressed for you or replace them with a reason for why the original comment wasn't addressed.

Contemplating whether to setup CI to compile it.

I use minted so please run the following before compiling:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
pip install Pygments mlir-pygments
```
